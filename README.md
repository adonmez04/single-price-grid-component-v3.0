## Welcome
I tried to use `CUBE CSS` and `fluid type units`. 
It took many hours of work, but I'm happy with the result.
I know it's not a big deal, but I think I passed another a milestone.
I learned that `line-height:normal` is not equal to `line-height:1.5` lol.
`line-height:normal` depends on the font family, but for desktop browsers it's usually `1.2'.

## For readable code
I think the biggest problem with CSS is writing readable code. I spent many hours on this and found this method CUBE CSS by Andy Bell. You can organise your CSS code according to on `design tokens` and use them in your code. This brings CSS and design closer together. You get clean, readable, scalable, and maintainable CSS code.
